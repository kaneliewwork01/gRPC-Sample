gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework with pluggable authentication and load balancing features. In this post, you will learn about gRPC and protocol buffers, how to build gRPC services in .NET Core/5 using C# and also how to create gRPC clients.

In this sample provided a gRPC server (GrpcService01) and .Net5 console program as gRPC client (GrpcServiceClient).
